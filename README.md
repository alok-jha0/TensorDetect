# TensorDetect
TensorDetect is a TensorFlow-based project for efficient object detection in real-time. Using pre-trained models and machine learning techniques, TensorDetect offers a streamlined solution for detecting objects in images and video streams. Inspired by TFODCourse, this project has been customized and enhanced to improve usability and performance.
# TensorDetect  

TensorDetect is a TensorFlow-based object detection project designed to identify objects efficiently.  
This project is inspired by [TFODCourse](https://github.com/nicknochnack/TFODCourse), but I have customized it to enhance its usability and functionality.  

## Features  
- Object detection using TensorFlow and pre-trained models.  
- Easy-to-follow implementation with step-by-step instructions.  
- Modified to include [your customizations].
